The plugin emits `relations.peopleRoles`, keyed by person summary ID, using
canonical PersonType string arrays. These describe this credit, independently
of the person profile type.
Book author credits emit `["Author"]`. No character names are fabricated.

This PR pins common interfaces 0.39.0 to its source revision while
the shared-interface release is pending.
