Author credits are returned as person objects in `relations.peopleDetails`,
with inline `roles: ["Author"]`. Unknown character names and rank are omitted.
No parallel credit maps or compatibility adapters are used.

This requires the matching server/interface 0.40.0 update. Update the server
and credit-producing plugins together, then refresh existing metadata as needed.
